The Open Source Web Comic

## What?
This comic will have a "staff" of writers and artists that contribute to its content, but they will not assume creative control of that content. Rather, the online community is encouraged to submit their ideas and take part in conversations about it. Those ideas and conversations will then be directly integrated into the comic. It's not a matter of whether we like the idea. If the discussion process itself goes well, the content is going in. That means it's **your** comic, not ours.

## Contributing
We'll have more concrete rules hammered out soon regarding contribution rules, but we know that concept art, wiki content, and the issue tracker will all be open to public contributions. More details to come regarding adding to the "staff".

## The Universe
The Universe is described by this comic through the telling of Arcs, Stories, Events, Moments, and Concepts.

#### Arcs
An Arc is a collection of Stories that tell a larger tale.

#### Stories
A Story is a complete sequence of Events.

#### Events
Events are events, nothing to understand there. Something happens, and there either is or isn't a reaction to that something.

#### Moments
Moments are just moments in time. A conversation, or the passing of several minutes on a street corner, etc.

#### Concepts
Concepts don't exist in time at all; rather, they convey an idea.

## The Basic Premise
As the title implies, this comic is ultimately about nerds. Geeks. The Electronically Inclined. The most central Arcs in The Universe will most often revolve around the core of nerds (the Nerdcore? nah...) central to this premise, but other than that, your imagination is the limit. Ninjas and Pirates? Sure. Aliens? Magic? Superheros? Pretty girls that actually speak to the ~~Nerdcore~~ core of nerds? Well, that last one's a bit of a stretch, but yes! Whatever you want!
